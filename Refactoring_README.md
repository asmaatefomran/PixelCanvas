# PixelCanvas Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of the PixelCanvas codebase, which implements various computer graphics algorithms for drawing lines, circles, curves, and performing operations like clipping and filling.

## Refactoring Goals

The primary goals of this refactoring were:

1. Create a consistent architecture with proper abstraction
2. Standardize class interfaces across all components
3. Remove code duplication
4. Improve error handling
5. Optimize algorithms
6. Enhance maintainability and readability

## Architecture

The refactored codebase follows a namespace-based organization, with all graphics components contained within the `Graphics` namespace. The main components include:

### Core Components

- **Graphics::Shape**: Base class for all drawable shapes
- **Graphics::Point**: Common 2D point structure
- **Graphics::ClipWindow**: Structure to represent a clipping window

### Shape Classes

- **Graphics::Line2D**: Line drawing with DDA, Midpoint, and Parametric algorithms
- **Graphics::Circle2D**: Circle drawing with Midpoint and Polar algorithms
- **Graphics::Curve2D**: Curve drawing with Bezier, Hermite, and Cardinal spline algorithms

### Algorithm Classes

- **Graphics::Clipping2D**: Line and polygon clipping using Cohen-Sutherland and Sutherland-Hodgman algorithms
- **Graphics::Fill2D**: Polygon filling with Scan-line, Convex, and Flood fill algorithms

### Enumeration Types

- **Graphics::Algorithm**: Enum for various drawing algorithms
- **Graphics::FillStyle**: Enum for fill styles
- **Graphics::FillQuarter**: Enum for quarter-filled circles
- **Graphics::FillAlgorithm**: Enum for filling algorithms

## Class Structure

Each class follows a consistent interface pattern:

1. Constructor that takes an HDC (device context handle)
2. Getter/setter methods for properties
3. A main `draw()` method that dispatches to the appropriate algorithm
4. Specialized drawing methods for each algorithm
5. Helper methods for specific calculations

## Improvements

### Code Organization

- Moved from procedural to object-oriented approach
- Created a hierarchy of classes with proper inheritance
- Separated UI code from drawing logic

### Interface Standardization

- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for methods, m_prefixForMembers)
- Uniform method signatures across similar classes
- Proper use of const and references

### Error Handling

- Added input validation in all drawing functions
- Handled edge cases (zero length, etc.)
- Implemented appropriate fallbacks

### Algorithm Optimization

- Improved midpoint algorithm implementations
- Used more efficient data structures for filling algorithms
- Added early termination conditions

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive comments for all classes and methods
- Explained complex algorithms with step-by-step comments
- Provided usage examples

## Usage Examples

### Drawing a Line

```cpp
#include "include/Line2D.h"

// Create a line
Graphics::Line2D line(hdc);

// Set properties
line.setStartPoint(Graphics::Point(100, 100));
line.setEndPoint(Graphics::Point(200, 200));
line.setColor(RGB(255, 0, 0));
line.setThickness(2);

// Draw using DDA algorithm
line.draw(Graphics::Algorithm::DDA);
```

### Clipping a Polygon

```cpp
#include "include/Clipping2D.h"

// Create a clipping object
Graphics::Clipping2D clipper(hdc);

// Set the clipping window
clipper.setClipWindow(100, 100, 400, 300);

// Define a polygon
std::vector<Graphics::Point> polygon = {
    {50, 50}, {450, 150}, {300, 350}, {150, 250}
};

// Clip the polygon
std::vector<Graphics::Point> clippedPolygon = clipper.clipPolygon(polygon);

// Draw the clipped polygon
// ...
```

## Migration Guide

To migrate from the old code to the new architecture:

1. Replace direct drawing functions with appropriate class instances
2. Update function calls to use the new method names
3. Replace old data structures with the new Point class
4. Update enumerations to use the new enum classes

## Build Instructions

The refactored code can be built using the existing build scripts. No changes to the build process are required.

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for all components
- Implement additional curve types (B-splines, etc.)
- Enhance performance with parallel processing for fill algorithms
- Add support for anti-aliasing
