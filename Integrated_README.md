# PixelCanvas - Fully Integrated with Advanced Clipping

This is the fully integrated version of PixelCanvas that includes all drawing tools and the advanced clipping functionality.

## Features

- **Line Drawing Algorithms**: DDA, Midpoint, Parametric
- **Circle Drawing Algorithms**: Direct, Polar, Midpoint
- **Ellipse Drawing Algorithms**: Direct, Polar, Midpoint (3-point method)
- **Curve Algorithms**: Bezier, Hermite, Cardinal Spline
- **Clipping Algorithms**: 
  - Cohen-Sutherland (line clipping)
  - Liang-Barsky (line clipping)
  - Sutherland-Hodgman (polygon clipping)
- **Fill Algorithms**:
  - Convex Polygon Fill
  - General Polygon Fill
  - Flood Fill (recursive and queue-based)
  - Circle Fill with Lines
  - Circle Fill with Circles

## Building the Application

Run the included batch file:
```
build_integrated.bat
```

## Clipping Usage Instructions

### Basic Clipping (Original Implementation)

1. Select the "Clipping Window" tool from the Tools menu
2. Choose either "Cohen-Sutherland" or "Liang-Barsky" algorithm
3. Use right-clicks to define the clipping window
4. Then use left-clicks to define the line to be clipped

### Advanced Clipping (New Implementation)

#### Line Clipping
1. Select the "Line Clipping" tool from the Tools menu
2. **Defining Clip Window**:
   - Right-click twice to set the opposite corners of the clipping window
   - The clipping window will be drawn in blue
3. **Clipping Lines**:
   - Left-click to set the start point of a line
   - Left-click again to set the end point and see the clipped result
   - The original line will be shown in dotted green, and the clipped line in red

#### Polygon Clipping
1. Select the "Polygon Clipping" tool from the Tools menu
2. **Defining Clip Window**:
   - Right-click twice to set the opposite corners of the clipping window
   - The clipping window will be drawn in blue
3. **Clipping Polygons**:
   - Left-click to add vertices to your polygon
   - Right-click to complete the polygon and see the clipped result
   - The original polygon will be shown with thin lines, and the clipped polygon in red

## Notes

- The application automatically uses the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm when the Line Clipping or Polygon Clipping tools are selected
- You can clear the canvas using the "Clear Canvas" option in the File menu
- You can save your work as a bitmap using the "Save as Bitmap" option in the File menu

## Implementation Details

This version integrates the advanced Clipping2D class with the existing PixelCanvas application. The Clipping2D class provides:

- Cohen-Sutherland algorithm for line clipping
- Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm for polygon clipping
- Interactive UI for defining clip windows and testing clipping
